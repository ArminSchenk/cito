\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula object}

\item{data}{matrix or data.frame}

\item{family}{error distribution with link function, see details for supported family functions}

\item{hidden}{hidden units in layers, length of hidden corresponds to number of layers}

\item{activation}{activation functions, can be of length one, or a vector of activation functions for each layer. Currently supported: tanh, relu, leakyrelu, selu, or sigmoid}

\item{validation}{percantage of data set that should be taken as validation set (chosen randomly)}

\item{bias}{whether use biases in the layers, can be of length one, or a vector (number of hidden layers + 1 (last layer)) of logicals for each layer.}

\item{lambda}{lambda penalty, strength of regularization: \eqn{\lambda * (lasso + ridge)}}

\item{alpha}{weighting between lasso and ridge: \eqn{(1 - \alpha) * |weights| + \alpha ||weights||^2}}

\item{dropout}{probability of dropout rate}

\item{optimizer}{which optimizer used for training the network,}

\item{lr}{learning rate given to optimizer}

\item{batchsize}{how many samples data loader loads per batch}

\item{shuffle}{TRUE if data should be reshuffled every epoch (default: FALSE)}

\item{epochs}{epochs for training loop}

\item{plot}{plot training loss}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to optimizer}
