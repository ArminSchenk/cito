cito aims at helping you build and train Neural Networks with the standard R syntax. It allows the whole model creation process and training to be done with one line of code. Furthermore, all generic R methods such as print or  plot can be used on the created object. It is based on the torch machine learning framework which is natively available for R. Therefore no Python installation or any further API is needed for this package. 

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) is available with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("citoverse/cito")
```
