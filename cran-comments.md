## cito submission 2022/07/18
Hello, 

Thanks for the feedback, I adressed all your points below.

Best, Christian

>Please always write package names, software names and API (application programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description.
e.g: --> 'R'
Please note that package names are case sensitive.

Done.


>If there are references describing the methods in your package, please add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) <doi:...> authors (year) <arXiv:...> authors (year, ISBN:...) or if those are not available: <https:...> with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking.
(If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")

There is no publication yet.  

>Please add \value to .Rd files regarding exported methods and explain the functions results in the documentation. Please write about the structure of the output (class) and also what the output means.
(If a function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g.
\value{No return value, called for side effects} or similar) Missing Rd-tags:
      ALE.Rd: \value
      PDP.Rd: \value
      plot.citodnn.Rd: \value
      print.summary.citodnn.Rd: \value
      
Done.     
      
>Please unwrap the examples if they are executable in < 5 sec, or replace \dontrun{} with \donttest{}.

Done, replaced \\dontrun{} with \\donttest{}. 

>Please do not install packages in your functions, examples or vignette.
This can make the functions, examples and cran-check very slow.

Done.

> Error: Error: <callr_remote_error: Failed to build source package 'igraph'>

This seems to be a temporary problem with the windows and I expect it to be gone in a couple of days.


1 Note for all Win-builder logs:
