Description: Creation of Neural Networks with one line of code and typical R syntax. This package simplifys the process of creating and validating Neural Network based on the R nativ torch impementation. So far only deep neural networks (DNNs) can be trained, however it is planned to include RNNs, CNNs and VAE.
